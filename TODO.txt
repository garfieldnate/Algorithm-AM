Figure out 'cannot remove directory' errors from dzil release
Figure out good project organization to allow dual builders (MB and EUMM)

Make printing clearer (label gangs, etc.)
put argument handling in one place

remove references to 'the red book'; put all documentation in the code!
output something about the number of features in the vectors contained in a data file

Read through documentation, update/clean if necessary
	Include Wikipedia pictures
Look at API. Update/clean if necessary.
Create an AM old stuff branch
tests!
	classification accuracy:
		normal, quadratic	(done)
		normal, linear 		(done)
		nulls				(done)
			include			(done)
			exclude			(done)
				this is different from what Java AM does
		given				(done)
			include			(done)
			exclude			(done)
	formats
		commas=yes/no		(done)
		future arff, csv, etc.?
	gangs					(done)
		this needs to be made into a hash that can be retrieved
		needs better printing
	skipset					(done)
		this needs to be made into a hash that can be retrieved
	repeat					(done)
	probability				(done)
	hooks
		will probably provide a better way to test everything else
		hooks:
			-beginhook
			-endhook
			-begintesthook
			-endtesthook
			-endrepeathook
			-beginrepeathook
			-datahook
		variables:
			beginning:
				@outcomelist
				%outcometonum
				@outcome
				@data
				@spec
			per-item:
				$curTestOutcome
				@curTestItem
				$curTestSpec
			per-iteration:
				$probability
				$pass
				$datacap
			end:
				@sum
				$pointertotal
				$pointermax
			formatting:
				$dformat
				$sformat
				$oformat
				$vformat
				$pformat
		bigcmp

allow user to specify input format
	specify bigsep, littlesep
	specify comment character
get rid of difficult (but extremely cool) __DATA__ hack
	At first, put __DATA__ in a separate file for easier browsing
	Maybe use Text::Template or Template toolkit instead of hand markings
Fix import mechanism
	pass info to hooks as arguments instead of messing with the symbol table

Release!
	2.3? 2.4?
