Algorithm::AM

Right now: Add methods to get more classification details from Result, and switch all classification tests over to using this API so we can STOP PRINTING EVERYTHING! Also, try to comment the gang printing code when possible. What are the itemcontextchain and itemcontextchainhead variables?

Try to move more of the AM guts stuff back into AM.pm or into Project.pm, or into a new Guts.pm. Right now quite a bit of it is in Result, which seems sub-par.

Move format variables into Result. Perhaps only save information important for making these in Project, and make them accessible.

Refactor and make result able to return structured, detailed information, such as items in the analogical set, etc., instead of just providing them through print methods.
Add docs for methods in Result.
Do better time handling in Result; something that will allow checking how long classification took would be nice.

Don't print out both exclude_given and given_excluded. exclude_given only matters if given_excluded is true, and then exclude_given has to be true.

Add other bigint helper methods into BigInt and test them, as well.

Auto-import Result and Project when caller imports AM.pm.

Make '=' into a constant somewhere so it obvious that it represents UNKNOWN_VARIABLE.

Instead of passing around the "activeVars" variable and skipping nulls if needed, it might make more sense to create an array containing all of the active indices, i.e. [0,1,2,4,6,7] if 3 and 5 are null and exclude nulls is on. This would make it easier to simplify things via `map` or whatever.

Scrub the code for consistent naming. "Data" should be given, or training, or exemplar. Everything is data, so why call anything "data"?

Rename subtooutcome. Should be contexttooutcome to be consistent with everything else.

Analogical set and gang effects are almost the same thing, and could probably be presented together in a unified format.

It set printing probably looks redundant now, since like-numbers are grouped together. Maybe this can be presented better somehow.

require user to create and pass in the Project object?
	- this would allow us to change commas to boolean and still check for non-existence (more gracefully than otherwise).

change commas to be either 1 or 0
	maybe it would be even better to create a "formatting" flag that can be given the name of a class that reads and returns project data.

test properly that classification arguments can be given with either the constructor or the classify() method. Might be easier after we have results objects that can report that properly.

check that data and test and outcome lines are formatted properly, don't just assume that they are (above change will make it easier).

Change Project::add_data and add_test so that 1) you don't input the long outcome name and 2) the spec is last (since it's optional; this way you don't have to input undef).
The whole long/short thing is broken. You should not be allowed to have more than one short/long outcome combination. Add a separate Project method for registering a long name for a short name. Or maybe better yet, get rid of the idea of short and long outcome names. Shouldn't the client handle that themselves? They should know their own labels.

perhaps require/allow user to input number of variables in their vectors in the constructor?

May be helpful to add little readme files explaining each of the test data projects.

do something better than just calling rand() for the probability/skip function.

Projects normally contain separate datasets for training/testing/evaluating. Create another module to hold a dataset. Project can manage 2 datasets (data and test). This would be much more flexible.

error checking for getting data data at a specific index; make sure it's a legal index.

possibly create a DataSet class to pass to new Projects.

change $self->{data/outcome/spec} to $self->{data}->{data/outcome/spec}. $self->{outcome/outcomes} are too similarly named.

Move the XS code to a different package so all of those variables can be stored in something private: pointers, itemcontextchainhead, etc. The work done on gangs could also be put into this package, since it requires special knowledge of the underlying structure. Maybe the Guts package?

Use undef instead of increment for making unique string lists using hashes.

It seems Theron expected no more than 60 data columns. Maybe warn somewhere if more than that are used.

factor out data line parsing into a single routine

Create Algorithm::AM::Datum object to pass to hooks. Add accessors that make the use of outcometonum, outcomelist, etc. obsolete. They are gross.

Make a single method for reading a data/test file, and move the creation of the format variables to their own loop. Or decide not to.

Change the POD to use Pod::Weaver properly (=method, etc.).

Create tests for each of the example programs in the documentation. This way they are forced to be updated as the API is updated.

change activeVars to be accepted at classification time

ask someone about expected outcome file format
	- finnverb outcome file does not have unique long outcomes to match unique short ones
	- short outcome column seems redundant with data file

work on types of input to AM dataset

-allow user to specify input format
	specify bigsep, littlesep
	specify comment character

-allow user to pass in actual data instead of using project file.

properly destroy project or AM object on error so that illegal state is not possible even if someone catches an error and tries to continue.

##Printing TODOs:
-Split print_summary into two methods: print_config and print_data_stats
-Make printing clearer (label gangs, etc.)
-output something about the number of features in the vectors contained in a data file (I think this is done. Just make it clearer?)
-Refactor gangs param into two different boolean params
- change logger to Log::Any
- return classification result objects that have print methods, instead of just printing everything

## Other TODOs:

- update HISTORY pod section in AM.pm
-Figure out good project organization to allow dual builders (MB and EUMM)
-Create an AM old stuff branch

-make sure decisions on what is in $self and what is in $data are good
	so far, $self has options and $data has info about the input data
		Not so! Now $self has @data, @outcome, and @spec
	It'd be better if $data had classification information (a result object), another variable had per-iteration information, and $self had everything else
	Create accessors for $self

-Eliminate outcometonum
	- using an accessor of some kind

-get rid of difficult (but extremely cool) __DATA__ hack
	At first, put __DATA__ in a separate file for easier browsing
	Maybe use Text::Template or Template toolkit instead of hand markings

#Eventual refactoring plan:
	Algorithm::AM object should be a single classifier, not a batch runner.
		classify() method should classify a single vector
		Should move iteration, and iter vars, into a separate class.
			This will make testing much easier, since we can then simply return classification outcomes in a single variable and test it, instead of testing printed output or accumulating outcomes and testing them.
		Don't print as we go; provide print methods or a verbose option
			also provide method for grabbing format variables
			pass the AM object to hooks so that these are usable
	I think beginning vars should just be in the AM object;
	format vars should also be in the AM object
	usage of outcometonum should be replaced with a method
	@sum should be replaced with something with index starting at 0
		possibly rename to "subtotals"
	I think endvars should be a return value besides being available in the hook.
		should probably also return the entire analogical set...

## Documentation TODOs:
-Read through documentation, update/clean if necessary
	Include Wikipedia pictures
-Define "specifier" early on in the documentation. Give the anatomy of a data file.
-Mention that the specifier is the data unless otherwise specified
-remove references to 'the red book'; put all documentation in the code!
