Algorithm::AM

test outcome file with exports.t

Next: Write tests for Project.pm. This should make portability an easier goal, as all tests dependent on line endings would be isolated in a single file.

Create Algorithm::AM::Datum object to pass to hooks. Add accessors that make the use of outcometonum, outcomelist, etc. obsolete. They are gross.

Make a single method for reading a data/test file, and move the creation of the format variables to their own loop. Or decide not to.

Create tests for each of the example programs in the documentation. This way they are forced to be updated as the API is updated.

write tests for new types of errors generated in Project.pm

work on types of input to AM dataset

move the autoflush call to the classify routine

change activeVars to be accepted at classification time

ask someone about expected outcome file format
	- finnverb outcome file does not have unique long outcomes to match unique short ones
	- short outcome column seems redundant with data file

To test:
	-Print formatting variables

-allow user to specify input format
	specify bigsep, littlesep
	specify comment character

-allow user to pass in actual data instead of using project file.

##Printing TODOs:
-Split print_summary into two methods: print_config and print_data_stats
-Make printing clearer (label gangs, etc.)
-output something about the number of features in the vectors contained in a data file (I think this is done. Just make it clearer?)
-Refactor gangs param into two different boolean params
- eventually get rid of logger, or do something else with it.
	- all useful info should probably be printed, since we're not guaranteed that the user will look at the logs
	- but a logger shouldn't just print to output. Use Log::Any if a logger of some kind is wanted

## Other TODOs:

-rename 'outcome' to something else. Comparison, golden, expected...
- create HISTORY pod section in AM.pm
-Figure out 'cannot remove directory' errors from dzil release
-Figure out good project organization to allow dual builders (MB and EUMM)
-Create an AM old stuff branch

-make sure decisions on what is in $self and what is in $data are good
	so far, $self has options and $data has info about the input data
		Not so! Now $self has @data, @outcome, and @spec
	It'd be better if $data had classification information (a result object), another variable had per-iteration information, and $self had everything else
	Create accessors for $self

-Eliminate outcometonum
	- using an accessor of some kind

-get rid of difficult (but extremely cool) __DATA__ hack
	At first, put __DATA__ in a separate file for easier browsing
	Maybe use Text::Template or Template toolkit instead of hand markings

#Eventual refactoring plan:
	Algorithm::AM object should be a single classifier, not a batch runner.
		classify() method should classify a single vector
		Should move iteration, and iter vars, into a separate class.
			This will make testing much easier, since we can then simply return classification outcomes in a single variable and test it, instead of testing printed output or accumulating outcomes and testing them.
		Don't print as we go; provide print methods or a verbose option
			also provide method for grabbing format variables
			pass the AM object to hooks so that these are usable
	I think beginning vars should just be in the AM object;
	format vars should also be in the AM object
	usage of outcometonum should be replaced with a method
	@sum should be replaced with something with index starting at 0
		possibly rename to "subtotals"
	I think endvars should be a return value besides being available in the hook.
		should probably also return the entire analogical set...

## Documentation TODOs:
-Write guide on porting old AM code.
	classify, not ->()
	variables
	running batches
	bigcmp
	parameters
-Read through documentation, update/clean if necessary
	Include Wikipedia pictures
-Define "specifier" early on in the documentation. Give the anatomy of a data file.
-Mention that the specifier is the data unless otherwise specified
-remove references to 'the red book'; put all documentation in the code!
